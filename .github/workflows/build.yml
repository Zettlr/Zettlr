# The last two events are being used to create nightly releases. The first    #
# event type indicates that the pipeline should build a regular release.      #
#                                                                             #
# HOW IT RUNS:                                                                #
#                                                                             #
# 1. Three virtual machines are spun up in parallel: A Windows VM, a Ubuntu   #
#    VM, and a macOS VM. All three are tasked with building all releases that #
#    we offer for the given platform. The Ubuntu VM builds the most since we  #
#    have many more Linux releases. Windows and macOS only build one x64 and  #
#    one ARM release. However, they also perform code signing (and            #
#    notarization in case of the macOS VM), which the Ubuntu VM doesn't do.   #
# 2. Each VM uploads all resulting artifacts into their respective artifact   #
#    space, named "linux", "darwin", and "win32" respectively (analogous to   #
#    node.js's process.platform-variable).                                    #
# 3. Iff (if and only if) all three runners have shut down successfully,      #
#    indicating successful builds, another Ubuntu VM will be started. That    #
#    one is tasked with downloading all releases from the three artifact      #
#    spaces, calculate the SHA-256 checksums for every file and afterwards    #
#    upload all files: In case of a nightly to the Zettlr server, where they  #
#    can be downloaded from nightly.zettlr.com, or, in case of a regular      #
#    release, to a newly created release draft here on GitHub.                #
#                                                                             #
# THINGS TO NOTE:                                                             #
#                                                                             #
# * Every runner will retrieve the package.json's "version" field by running  #
#   a somewhat weird-looking command. This is necessary to make finding the   #
#   releases easier which are being produced by electron-forge and electron-  #
#   builder.                                                                  #
# * Especially the macOS runner can often produce problems, because there     #
#   have been rumors that apparently even the macOS server operating systems  #
#   tend to open modal windows -- even though they're running headless. This  #
#   means that in case the macOS runners seem to hang it's likely we again    #
#   need to update the add-osx-cert.sh script.                                #
# * Everything is being run on Bash. Although PowerShell can do a lot, this   #
#   way all steps are within one language, making it easier to maintain.      #
#                                                                             #
