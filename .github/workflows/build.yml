# This file contains the logic necessary to build a full release from source. #
#                                                                             #
# Whenever someone creates a new git tag on the master branch, this workflow  #
# will be triggered, building the corresponding release for all platforms.    #
# This entails running three workers, one on Ubuntu, one on macos, and one on #
# Windows, in order to build the application. Each build worker clones the    #
# repository, installs the dependencies, then runs the actual build, before   #
# uploading the resulting artifact(s) to the worker's temporary space. After  #
# all three builds have been successfully completed, the last job worker will #
# start, download all created assets, generate the SHA256 checksums for them, #
# verify the sums, create a new release draft with the corresponding tag, and #
# finally upload all generated assets to the release draft.                   #
