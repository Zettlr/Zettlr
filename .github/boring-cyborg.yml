# Let's greet new users!

  Thank you for opening your first PR! üéâ We are very happy and would like
  to thank you very much for your contribution. If everything checks out, we'll
  make sure to review the PR as soon as possible and give feedback. In the
  meantime, to make the reviewing process as fast as possible, you can help us
  by checking the following things:

  - Did you follow the JSStandard coding style?
  - Did you comment everywhere where the necessity of a piece of code or the
    way it was implemented is not immediately obvious?
  - Did you attempt to stick as much to current coding habits as possible?
    (Note that this does not apply to pieces of code where we ourselves
    obviously violated good coding practices, which unfortunately happens
    sometimes. But please indicate this in your PR so that we know what you
    rectified!)

  Furthermore, make sure that the linter does not complain, which will check
  your code on every new commit. If the linter task fails, make sure to run
  `yarn lint` locally and check the file `eslint_report.htm` which will tell
  you precisely what went wrong.

  Stay sharp, and thanks again!

  Thanks so much for opening up your first issue here on the repository! üéâ
  We would like to warmly welcome you to the community behind the app! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
  We'll check in soon and have a look at your issue. In the meantime, you can
  check your issue and make sure it aligns with our contribution guidelines!
  Here's the comprehensive list:

  ## Enhancements

  An enhancement takes a feature and improves or alters its behaviour. Please
  make sure to argue how your proposition will aid non-technical text workers,
  and why it can't be emulated easily with other features or apps!

  ## Feature requests

  Feature requests introduce whole new features into the app. This requires a
  lot of work, so these might be turned down if the implementation costs
  supersede the benefits we expect to see from implementing it. Please do not
  be disappointed if that happens. It likely has nothing to do with your great
  request but simply with us and our missing resources!

  You can of course always ask someone to implement this feature, because a PR
  with a working new feature has much higher chances of being merged! :)

  ## Bug reports

  Please note that one of the main reasons for why bug reports cannot be
  addressed is that there's not enough information for us to find and fix the
  bug you describe, so make sure you try to pinpoint the bug as close as
  possible.

  The ideal bug report for us has two qualities:

  1. The bug is always reproducible, at least within a certain context.
  2. We know exactly what specifically goes wrong, and there is consensus on
     what should happen instead.

  Please note that if you encounter behaviour that does not align with your
  expectations of what would happen, this might as well be simply intended
  behaviour and we need to simply _clarify_ why the behaviour is the way it is.
  This is not to be considered a bug and such issues may be closed! Suggest an
  enhancement instead!

  But now, have a great day and thank you again!
