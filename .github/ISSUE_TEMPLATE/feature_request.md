<!--
  Thank you for proposing a new feature! To streamline our all efforts, please
  first read this short paragraph. If you can check all the boxes below, go for
  it and propose the feature!

  - [ ] Zettlr does not possess something similar (in which case it
        would be an enhancement, NOT a feature!)
  - [ ] I have searched the documentation to make sure I did not overlook it.
  - [ ] Zettlr's current features cannot be used to approximate this behaviour.
  - [ ] I have searched all issues (open and closed) to see if someone else
        wants something similar to which I could propose modifications (two
        features in one are easier and faster for us to implement).
  - [ ] I will prepend "[FEATURE]" to my issue title (this makes the list look much cleaner ;)

<!-- First, please describe your feature in one or two short sentences. -->
## Description

<!-- Then, please tell us how this should work. Try to think of as many edge-cases as possible! -->
<!-- P.S.: You can also propose multiple workflows. This will make it easier to implement. -->
## Example Workflow

<!-- Now, are there any caveats, such as other features that would be affected? -->
## Caveats

<!-- Anything else you'd like to add? The more info, the merrier! -->
