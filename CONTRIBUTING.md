# Contributing to Gettlr

Hey there.

First of all: Thanks for wanting to contribute. Anyone can contribute, no matter if you can actually code or just complain about unwanted behaviour. Everything helps this app to grow better for everybody.

I have no special requirements on how to commit to Gettlr yet. But some basic expectations I have about contributing (to both save time for me and you) will be listed below:

* If you found a bug, please open up an issue. Don't want to create a GitHub-Account for that? No problem, just email me at Gettlr@mailbox.org and I'll open up the issue myself.
* If you think some feature is behaving not as you would expect, please do the same (e.g., if you do not want to create a GitHub account first, email me!)
* If a feature you'd like to use is missing, the same applies!

## Contributing translations

Translations for all languages are welcome. To see the status of the current translations, head over to our [translation service](https://translate.Gettlr.com/). There a list of all languages currently available. You have the following options concerning translations:

* Translate localisation strings that haven't yet been translated in a language.
* Approve already translated strings, especially if there are multiple suggestions â€” choose the one you think is right.
* Suggest a new translation for a given localisation string if you think the existing ones are all not correct.

The service works using a community-guided algorithm, so in a final translation file only the string that has received the most approval will be included. You can read more about how the system works prior to registering [here](https://translate.Gettlr.com/welcome).

## Contributing code

After all, I'm very thankful for every piece of code I do not have to write on my own. So if you decide to add a feature on your own using forks and pull requests, please commit to the develop branch. Then I'll merge them as soon as possible and commit them to master. If there are branches dedicated to certain features, consider requesting the pull there, if your PR contributes to this specific feature (general bug fixes, of course, should be PR'd to develop).

## Anything else?

If there's anything else, you can use either GitHub or mail to contact me directly. If you think something is missing, please contact me!
