# ZETTLR DEFAULTS FILE
# ====================
# Conversion: Markdown --> Markdown
# More info: https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html
# ====================
# This export target can be used if you, for example, just want to render
# the citations in your document. Helpful if you want to publish your text
# on some platform that supports Markdown, but not all of Pandoc's features.
# NOTE that Zettlr will output the file with the ending `.markdown` instead of
# `.md`. This is by design to prevent you from accidentally overwriting your
# current working file when exporting to the current directory.
reader: markdown
# The default `markdown`-writer will output Pandoc's Markdown which is less
# compatible than the gfm (=GitHub Flavored Markdown) writer. Feel free to
# change the following line to any writer that supports Markdown.
