# Split View

Zettlr supports split views to make your work more productive. We have provided you with a sample layout using three editor panes (one left and two vertically stacked on the right) to demonstrate this functionality. You can drag and drop files to create new splits. Here's how it works:

* New files will always open in the last active pane (i.e. the one the cursor is in)
* You can drag the document tabs outside of the tab bar to move files around
* Moving tabs onto tab bars or into the central area of an editor will move the file to the corresponding pane
* Moving tabs to the side of any editor pane (top, right, bottom, left) will split the given pane into that direction
* Closing or moving away the last file of a pane will automatically close it
* Zettlr also supports multiple windows. Press `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+N` to open new windows
