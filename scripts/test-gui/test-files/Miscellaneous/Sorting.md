title: Sorting Test

# Heading 1

This is a test file featuring many headings to ensure the sorting algorithm works correctly. It is also being tested in the unit tests, but the GUI element also needs to provide the correct inputs. At the end of each single paragraph, there's an indication to which heading it belongs so that you can easily check that it works. (Heading 1)

> This is a blockquote within the section of (Heading 1)

# Heading 2

This is a second heading (Heading 2)

## Subheading 2.1

The first paragraph of (Subheading 2.1)

The second paragraph of (Subheading 2.1)

## Subheading 2.2

We have included a second subheading to enable good testing conditions (Subheading 2.2)

# Heading 3

One paragraph for (Heading 3)

A second paragraph for (Heading 3)

### Subheading 3.0.1

This heading skips one level, and thus should render as `3.0.1` (instead of, e.g., `3.1.1`) (Subheading 3.0.1)

However, even this heading should always stay within Heading 3 whenever you move Heading 3 (Subheading 3.0.1)
