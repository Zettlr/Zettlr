# Syntax Highlighting Tests

This directory contains several files that demonstrate syntax highlighting as supported by Zettlr. The languages have been grouped according to the grouping of [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/), where most examples come from. Some other examples were taken from Wikipedia, or written by ourselves.

Whenever you add more languages, make sure to add them to these tests as well.
