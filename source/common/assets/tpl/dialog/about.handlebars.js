By contrast,\n          the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\n          share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\n          software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\n          GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\n          any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to\n          your programs, too.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n          price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n          have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n          them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n          want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n          free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n          these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have\n          certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\n          you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n          gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n          freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive\n          or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they\n          know their rights.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n          (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n          giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n          that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and\n          authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\n          changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\n          authors of previous versions.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n          modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\n          can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\n          protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic\n          pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n          use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we\n          have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n          products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\n          stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\n          of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n          States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n          software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\n          avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\n          make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that\n          patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n          modification follow.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2><a name=\"terms\"></a>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>\n\n        <h3><a name=\"section0\"></a>0.

If propagation of a covered\n          work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n          transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n          licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\n          give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n          Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\n          the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n          rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may\n          not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n          rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n          (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\n          any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\n          sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3><a name=\"section11\"></a>11. Patents.</h3>\n\n        <p>\n          A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n          License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\n          work thus licensed is called the contributor's &ldquo;contributor version&rdquo;.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          A contributor's &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent claims\n          owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\n          hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\n          by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\n          but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\n          consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For\n          purposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant\n          patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\n          this License.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n          patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\n          make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\n          propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is any express\n          agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n          (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\n          sue for patent infringement). To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to a\n          party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\n          patent against the party.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n          and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n          to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\n          publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\n          then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\n          available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\n          patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\n          consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\n          license to downstream recipients. &ldquo;Knowingly relying&rdquo; means you have\n          actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\n          covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\n          in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\n          country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n          arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\n          covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\n          receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\n          or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\n          you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\n          work and works based on it.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not include within\n          the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\n          conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\n          specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered\n          work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\n          in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\n          to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n          the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n          parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n          patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n          conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n          for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n          contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n          or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\n          any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\n          otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3><a name=\"section12\"></a>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h3>\n\n        <p>\n          If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n          otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n          excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a\n          covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n          License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\n          not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\n          to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\n          the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n          License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3><a name=\"section13\"></a>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</h3>\n\n        <p>\n          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n          permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n          under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\n          combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this\n          License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\n          but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\n          section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\n          combination as such.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3><a name=\"section14\"></a>14. Revised Versions of this License.</h3>\n\n        <p>\n          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\n          the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will\n          be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n          address new problems or concerns.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\n          Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\n          Public License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the\n          option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\n          version or of any later version published by the Free Software\n          Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the\n          GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\n          by the Free Software Foundation.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\n          versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\n          public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\n          to choose that version for the Program.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Later license versions may give you additional or different\n          permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\n          author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\n          later version.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3><a name=\"section15\"></a>15.
