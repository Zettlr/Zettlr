 * Description:     This plugin ensures that lines in soft-wrapped editors are
 *                  visually correctly indented. It additionally ensures that
 *                  lists, etc. are correctly indented so that the list marker
 *                  is placed outside of the text block.

  // Then, retrieve all lines that are indentable via this plugin. These are:
  // All lines that are part of the current viewport and that are not part of a
  // code block. Why no code block? First, code blocks will always be in
  // monospace. (If you use Custom CSS to make them non-monospaced, you are a
  // cruel human being and deserve to be punished.) Second, if we mess with the
  // indentation and padding of lines within code blocks, we mess up the
  // calculations that happen to apply the gray background to our code blocks,
  // which will make it look like a visual bug.

    // indentation even for non-monospaced text. What we want to measure is
    // exclusively what we are basing our indentation on. If we use the entire
    // line as a key, we cause (a) duplicated measurements (`* One` and `* Two`
    // require the same indentation) and (b) cause cache misses which results in
    // jumpy behavior when the user adds novel characters to the line.
