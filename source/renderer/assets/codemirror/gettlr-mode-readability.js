  /**
  * INTRODUCTION
  *
  * Some of the following algorithms need the amount of difficult
  * or complex words that appear inside a given sentence. These are
  * mostly not computed but given in form of a dictionary. So the
  * "correct" application of these algorithms would be to either
  * look up all words in a sentence in a provided dictionary, or to
  * calculate the amount of syllables of each word. "Difficult" words
  * are mainly calculated with dictionaries, while "complex" words
  * are mostly defined by the amount of syllables. Another difficulty
  * with many of the algorithms is that they have been developed with
  * the English language in mind. Thereby, other languages face huge
  * problems when it comes to appropriate readability scores. To
  * alleviate these problems and to make sure the algorithm is both
  * fast and language-agnostic, both complex and difficult words are
  * re-defined for the purposes of this CodeMirror mode as following:
  *
  * Complex or difficult words are words whose number of characters
  * exceeds the threshold of two times the standard deviation of the
  * average word length inside a given sentence. This means that the
  * probability of difficult words is defined to be 5 percent of the
  * language (as two times the standard deviation around the average
  * value includes 95 % of all possible values).
  *
  * This is a statistically sound measure, because this way we
  * set the bar of the presumed skill of reading to be higher than
  * average (as 5 percent difficult words will mainly apply to
  * academics, journalists, and generally people that work a lot with
  * text). Additionally, according to Coleman and Liau, who devised
  * the Coleman-Liau readability algorithm: "There is no need to
  * estimate syllables since word length in letters is a better
  * predictor of readability than word length in syllables."
  * (1975, see https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/1975-22007-001.pdf)
