## Where to Get Help

The community of Zettlr is present on various platforms on the internet, where they actively help each other out – and not just with regard to using the application, but also with how to contribute easily and effectively.

Each platform has a specific thematic focus:

* [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/issues) is the most tech-focused part of the Zettlr community.
* [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/discussions) is the place to go for more theoretical discussions (discussing new features, asking general questions).
* On our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/PcfS3DM9Xj) we help each other out in "real-time" with the immediacy of instant messaging.
* On [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettlr/) we have all kinds of discussions, forum-style.

**Please note: Do NOT open issues on GitHub if you have questions on how to help/with your PR. Please ask these questions on any of the other platforms!**

## Contribute to Zettlr

As an Open Source application, Zettlr always welcomes contributions from the community. There are numerous ways to contribute and **you do not necessarily need to know how to write code to help**! 

Below we list several ideas for ways in which you can help evolve Zettlr. 

### Help Us Translate Zettlr Into Your Language

Our aim is to support as many languages as possible to make Zettlr a truly international application. As of now, more than a dozen languages are already available, but there is always room for improvement.

Translating does not require technical knowledge, so anyone with a bit of time can contribute. In fact, the Zettlr development team maintains the English and German translations, but all the other translations have been created by our community!

Zettlr uses the [gettext system](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) for translating content. The translations are stored in the [`static/lang` directory](./static/lang), in files with the `.po` extension. In this directory you will find files like `fr-FR.po` for French, and `pt-BR.po` for Brazilian Portuguese, for example.

To improve a translation, simply download and edit the corresponding `*.po` file. You can edit `.po` files with a simple text editor, or, if you prefer a more comfortable graphical editor, one good option is the Open Source editor [POedit](https://poedit.net/).

Once you are happy with your changes, open a Pull Request here on GitHub that updates the corresponding file. GitHub has a great [guide on how to open Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files#editing-files-in-another-users-repository).

### Help Us Improve Zettlr's Documentation

Good documentation is accurate and up-to-date. As Zettlr improves existing features or introduces new ones, keeping the documentation current is of utmost importance.

To help with the documentation, [take a look at its repository](https://github.com/Zettlr/zettlr-docs). If you spot any mistakes or opportunities for improvements, fork the repository and make the necessary changes. Trust your gut — if you feel like something is poorly explained, you are probably right. Once you are done with the changes, open a Pull Request and we will make sure to merge it as soon as possible. **Please remember to check your notifications afterwards, as we might have some remarks and comment on your PR!**

### Contribute Code

If you have some experience with developing, we gladly welcome your help in fixing issues and adding features. Even if you just getting started with programming, there are tons of smaller things and chores to do, so by cleaning up code here and there you can improve your skills and also help the project. Even if it's a minor fix, it is still a fix!

#### GitHub Issue Labels

There are, broadly speaking, three categories of issues in the Zettlr GitHub issue tracker, which you can distinguish with their associated labels.

1. **Bugs** come in two flavors: non-critical and critical. Non-critical bugs represent a nuisance but do not seriously affect the use of the app. Critical bugs, on the other hand, make Zettlr behave in unexpected ways, and, thus, need to be addressed urgently. Normally, the latter is taken care of by the core team.
2. **Enhancements** are small improvements that require adding some functionality to existing features, but that should not evolve into their own distinct features. Even if the issue description reads like a full feature to you, the "enhancement" label means there is already said functionality, which just needs to be amended. Please ask if you are unsure.
3. **Features** are bigger additions to the application that require more-involved discussion, design, and development. These can take some time, but could also prove to be a nice winter project.

If you want to help, make sure to _communicate your intent_, that is:

1. If you want to tackle an issue, comment on it and say that you want to develop a PR. In the PR, please link to the issue so other contributors have visibility that the issue is being worked on.
2. If you want to tackle an issue, but along the way realize that you ran out of time and can't finish it: _communicate it_! This is an Open Source project, and retracting is no shame, but not communicating that you cannot finish something will hinder all the other people involved.
3. If you have a PR and are not completely sure about whether it's right, or not, just open the PR and outline your questions there. It is much easier to work with something we can see and improve the PR than if you ask without something concrete.

In any case, just remember to just open PRs and dive in. The worst that could happen is that we ask you to rewrite some file, but that has never happened and is pretty unlikely to happen in the future.

#### Zettlr's Tech Stack

Zettlr is an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)-based app, so to start developing, you'll need to have the following installed on your computer:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Make sure it's at least Node 14 (`lts/fermium`). To test what version you have, run `node -v`.
2. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/). This is the package manager for the project. We do not commit `package-lock.json` files so many commands require `yarn`. You can install Yarn globally with NPM using `npm install -g yarn`, or you can install it with Homebrew if you are on macOS.
3. On Windows, we recommend that you [install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). It will make many of the next steps easier.
4. A few command-line utilities that the build script requires to download Pandoc to your development setup:
    * [`cURL`](https://curl.se/download.html)
    * `unzip`
5. Zettlr requires a few native C++ modules that must be compiled before running the app, so you will need to install an appropriate build toolchain for your operating system :
    * **macOS**: Installing the XCode command-line tools via `xcode-select --install` suffices.
    * **Windows**: You will need the [free Visual Studio development tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/) that include the required tools.
    * **Linux**: There are a variety of compatible toolchains available, sometimes they are already preinstalled. Refer to your distribution's manual for more information.

Then, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies on your local computer:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr.git
$ cd Zettlr
$ yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

The `--frozen-lockfile` flag ensures that Yarn will stick to the versions as listed in the `yarn.lock` and not attempt to update them.

During development, hot module reloading (HMR) is active so that you can edit the renderer's code easily and hit `F5` after the changes have been compiled by `electron-forge`. You can keep the developer tools open to see when HMR has finished loading your changes.

#### What Should I Know To Contribute Code?

In order to provide code, you should have basic familiarity with the following technologies (ordered by descending importance):

* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) (especially asynchronous code) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/)
* [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs)
* [Vue.js 3.x](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) and [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)
* [CodeMirror 6.x](https://codemirror.net/docs/)
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
* [LESS](https://lesscss.org/#)
* [webpack 5.x](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)
* [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/)
* [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/)

> Note: See the "Directory Structure" section below to get an overview of how the Zettlr code base is structured.

#### Development Commands

This section lists all the available commands that you can use during application development. These are defined within the `package.json` file and can be run from the command line by prefixing them with `yarn`. Run them from within the base directory of the repository.

##### `start`

Starts `electron-forge`, which will build the application and launch it in development mode. This will use the normal settings, so if you use Zettlr on the same computer in production, it will use the same configuration files as the regular application. This means: **be careful when breaking things**. If you want to be safe, it's better to use `test-gui` (see below).

##### `package`

Packages the application, but does not bundle it into an installer. Without any suffix, this command will package the application for your current platform and architecture. To create specific packages (may require running on the corresponding platform), the following suffixes are available:

- `package:mac-x64` (Intel-based Macs)
- `package:mac-arm` (Apple Silicon-based Macs)
- `package:win-x64` (Intel-based Windows)
- `package:win-arm` (ARM-based Windows)
- `package:linux-x64` (Intel-based Linux)
- `package:linux-arm` (ARM-based Linux)

The resulting application packages are stored in `./out`.

> This command will skip typechecking to speed up builds, so be extra cautious.

##### `release:{platform-arch}`

Packages the application and then bundles it into an installer for the corresponding platform and architecture. To create such a bundle (may require running on the corresponding platform), one of the following values for `{platform-arch}` is required:

- `release:mac-x64` (Intel-based Macs)
- `release:mac-arm` (Apple Silicon-based Macs)
- `release:win-x64` (Intel-based Windows)
- `release:win-arm` (ARM-based Windows)
- `release:linux-x64` (Intel-based Linux)
- `release:linux-arm` (ARM-based Linux)

The resulting setup bundles are stored in `./release`.

> Please note that, while you can _package_ directly for your platform without any suffix, creating a _release_ **requires** that you specify the platform (otherwise electron-builder will include the development-dependencies in the `app.asar`, resulting in a bloated application).

##### `csl:refresh`

This downloads the [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/) (CSL) files with which the application is shipped, and places them in the `static/csl-locales` and `static/csl-styles` directories, respectively.

> Please note, that this command is intended for an automated workflow that runs from time to time on the repository to perform this action. This means: Do **not** commit updated files to the repository. Instead, the updated files will be downloaded whenever you `git fetch`.

##### `lint`

This simply runs [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). Apps such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) will automatically run ESLint in the background, but if you want to be extra-safe, make sure to run this command prior to submitting a Pull Request.

> This command will run automatically on each Pull Request to check your code for inconsistencies.

##### `reveal:build`

This re-compiles the source-files needed by the exporter for building [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) presentations. Due to the nature of how [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) creates such presentations, Zettlr needs to modify the output of Pandoc, which is why these files need to be pre-compiled.

> Please note, that this command is intended for an automated workflow that runs from time to time on the repository to perform this action. This means: Do **not** commit updated files to the repository. Instead, the updated files will be downloaded whenever you `git fetch`.

##### `test`

This runs the unit tests in the directory `./test`. Make sure to run this command prior to submitting a Pull Request. These unit tests will be run automatically every time you commit to the PR, so run them in advance to ensure that there are no issues. This will make the whole PR process easier.

##### `test-gui`

Use this command to safely test any changes you make to the application. This command will start the application as if you ran `yarn start`, but will provide a custom configuration and a custom directory.

> This command will skip typechecking to speed up builds, so be extra cautious.

**The first time you start this command**, pass the `--clean`-flag to copy a bunch of test-files to your `./resources`-directory, create a `test-config.yml` in your project root, and start the application with this clean configuration. Then, you can adapt the `test-config.yml` to your liking (so that certain settings which you would otherwise _always_ set will be pre-set without you having to open the preferences).

Whenever you want to reset the test directory to its initial state (or you removed the directory, or cloned the whole project anew), pass the flag `--clean` to the command in order to create or reset the directory. **This is also necessary if you changed something in `test-config.yml`**.

If you want to prevent a config-file from being created (e.g., to simulate the first start experience), you can pass the flag `--no-config` to this command.

You can pass additional command-line switches such as `--clear-cache` to this command as well. They will be passed to the child process.

> Attention: Before first running the command, you **must** run it with the `--clean`-flag to create the directory in the first place!

Additionally, have a look at our [full development documentation](https://docs.zettlr.com/en/get-involved).

#### Directory Structure

Zettlr is a mature app that has amassed hundreds of directories over the course of its development. Since it is hard to contribute to an application without any guidance, we have compiled a short description of the directories and how they interrelate.

#### On the Distinction Between Modules and Service Providers

You'll notice that Zettlr contains both "modules" and "service providers". The difference between the two is simple: Service providers run in the main process and are completely autonomous while providing functionality to the app as a whole. Modules, on the other hand, provide functionality that must be triggered by user actions (e.g. the exporter and the importer).

#### The Application Lifecycle

Whenever you run Zettlr, the following steps will be executed:

0. Execute `source/main.ts`
1. Environment check (`source/app/lifecycle.ts::bootApplication`)
2. Boot service providers (`source/app/lifecycle.ts::bootApplication`)
3. Boot main application (`source/main/zettlr.ts`)
4. Load the file tree and the documents
5. Show the main window

And when you shut down the app, the following steps will run:

1. Close all windows except the main window
2. Attempt to close the main window
3. Shutdown the main application (`source/main/zettlr.ts::shutdown`)
4. Shutdown the service providers (`source/app/lifecycle.ts::shutdownApplication`)
5. Exit the application

During development of the app (`yarn start` and `yarn test-gui`), the following steps will run:

1. Electron Forge will compile the code for the main process and each renderer process separately (since these are separate processes), using TypeScript and webpack to compile and transpile.
2. Electron Forge will put that code into the directory `.webpack`, replacing the constants you can find in the "create"-methods of the window manager with the appropriate entry points.
3. Electron Forge will start a few development servers to provide hot module reloading (HMR) and then actually start the application.

Whenever the app is built, the following steps will run:

1. Electron Forge will perform steps 1 and 2 above, but instead of running the app, it will package the resulting code into a functional app package.
2. electron-builder will then take these pre-built packages and wrap them in a platform-specific installer (DMG files, Windows installer, or Linux packages).

Electron Forge will put the packaged applications into the directory `./out` while electron-builder will put the installers into the directory `./release`.

#### Command Line Switches

The Zettlr binary features a few command line switches that you can make use of for different purposes.

##### `--launch-minimized`

This CLI flag will instruct Zettlr not to show the main window on start. This is useful to create autostart entries. In that case, launching Zettlr with this flag at system boot will make sure that you will only see its icon in the tray.

Since this implies the need to have the app running in the tray bar or notification area when starting the app like this, it will automatically set the corresponding setting `system.leaveAppRunning` to true.

> Note: This flag will not have any effect on Linux systems which do not support displaying an icon in a tray bar or notification area.

##### `--clear-cache`

This will direct the File System Abstraction Layer to fully clear its cache on boot. This can be used to mitigate issues regarding changes in the code base. To ensure compatibility with any changes to the information stored in the cache, the cache is also automatically cleared when the version field in your `config.json` does not match the one in the `package.json`, which means that, as long as you do not explicitly set the `version`-field in your `test-config.yml`, the cache will always be cleared on each run when you type `yarn test-gui`.

##### `--data-dir=path`

Use this switch to specify custom data directory, which holds your configuration files. Without this switch data directory defaults to `%AppData%/Zettlr` (on Windows 10), `~/.config/Zettlr` (on Linux), etc. The path can be absolute or relative. Basis for the relative path will be either the binary's directory (when running a packaged app) or the repository root directory (when running an app that is not packaged). If the path contains spaces, do not forget to escape it in quotes. `~` to denote home directory does not work. Due to the bug in Electron an empty `Dictionaries` subdirectory is created in the default data directory, but it does not impact functionality.

##### `--disable-hardware-acceleration`

This switch causes Zettlr to disable hardware acceleration, which could be necessary in certain setups. For more information on why this flag was added, see issue [#2127](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/issues/2127).


#### VS Code Extension Recommendations

This repository makes use of Visual Studio Code's [recommended extensions feature](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=827846). This means that if you use VS Code and open the repository for the first time, VS Code will tell you that the repository recommends to install a handful of extensions. These extensions are recommended if you work with Zettlr and will make contributing much easier. The recommendations are specified in the file `.vscode/extensions.json`.

Since installing extensions is sometimes a matter of taste, we have added short descriptions for each recommended extension within that file to explain why we recommend it. This way you can make your own decision whether or not you want to install any of these extensions (for example, the SVG extension is not necessary if you do not work with the SVG files provided in the repository).

If you choose not to install all of the recommended extensions at once, VS Code will continue to show these recommendations in the extensions sidebar so you can manually install additional recommended extensions at a later time.

> Using the same extensions as the core developer team will make the code generally more consistent since you will have the same visual feedback.
